# Example
This repo demonstrates:
- Using CSS (Bootstrap framework) with the static HTML page
- Automatically generate and publish the index.html page on every data.yaml (or another file commit)
- Hosting HTML page not in the root folder
- Images are located in a dedicated folder
- Custom publishing workflow that starts only after a successful python page build
