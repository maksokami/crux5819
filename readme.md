# Example
This repo demonstrates:
- Using CSS (Bootstrap framework) with the static HTML page
- Using a python script and jinja2 HTML templating library to automatically generate and publish the index.html page on every data.yaml (or another file) commit
- Hosting HTML page not in the root folder
- Images are located in a dedicated folder
- Custom publishing workflow that starts only after a successful python page build
